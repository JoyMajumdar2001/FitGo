    <string name="sleep_1">Your behaviors during the day, and especially before bedtime, can have a major impact on your sleep. They can promote healthy sleep or contribute to sleeplessness.</string>
    <string name="sleep_2">Your daily routines – what you eat and drink, the medications you take, how you schedule your days and how you choose to spend your evenings – can significantly impact your quality of sleep. Even a few slight adjustments can, in some cases, mean the difference between sound sleep and a restless night.</string>
    <string name="sleep_3">The term “sleep hygiene” refers to a series of healthy sleep habits that can improve your ability to fall asleep and stay asleep. These habits can help improve your sleep health. When people struggle with insomnia, sleep hygiene is an important part of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the most effective long-term treatment for people with chronic insomnia. CBT for insomnia can help you address the thoughts and behaviors that prevent you from sleeping well. It also includes techniques for stress reduction, relaxation and sleep schedule management.</string>
    <string name="sleep_4">If you have difficulty sleeping or want to improve your sleep, try following these healthy sleep habits. Talk to your medical provider if your sleep problem persists. You also can seek help from the sleep team at an AASM accredited sleep center.</string>
